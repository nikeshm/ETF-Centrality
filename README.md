# ETF Centrality

An exchange-traded fund (commonly abbreviated as “ETF”) is a financial security that tracks a basket of related stocks but can be bought and sold on an exchange like other assets (Chen 2021). The purpose of ETFs is to allow investors to purchase a security that performs like a given group of stocks (often referred to as the ETF’s “holdings” or “basket”) without needing to purchase any stocks in this group; this also lowers investor risk. This project is analysis of how centrality of stocks within ETF stock correlation networks affects achieved returns.

Data was scraped from a Fidelity stock screener, and analyzed in Python.
